# Austin Practical Data Science

## Environment Setup

For all APDS meetups, we assume that you have a working Python notebook environment.
We recommend:
 - [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) (or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)) to manage your Python environments
 - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) to provide notebook interactivity

## Meetups

### July 2023 - Data Visualization
